    open your file manager and paste it on the path search and invert the slashes like this ðŸ‘‰C:\Users\mofe\AppData\Local\Programs\Python once you click you should see multiple python version folders
    if you see python 39 then it was installed and it's in the path
    then paste this path on your terminal
    C:\Users\(PC OWNERS NAME HERE)\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python --version

    type -> mv patcher_01.py patcher.py
    type -> mv patcher.py liker_venv/Lib/site-packages/undetected_chromedriver/ (if this doesnt work try swithing the slashes to "\")

10 - add newly created gmail accounts to the accounts.json file (i just kept that account there so you understand how to add new accounts, Dont run the script with the account there so it doesnt get flagged for multiple IPs)

11 - add your comments link to the urls.json file (Note if you run using the same urls it will unlike already liked comments)

12 - There are two ways to run the script
    1 - type -> python run.py (This is running the script directly)
    2 - type -> python -m application (This way will render a flask server Like the one you currently tested
                                        open chrome and go to the address(http://127...))


THINGS TO NOTE

1 - When creating an email address make sure to add backup email as a mode of verification not Numbers

2 - if you want to see the way the script functions 
    with chrome working in the background go to this path 
    ðŸ‘‰ liker_venv_2\Lib\site-packages\login_gmail_selenium\util\base_profile.py
    go to line 81 and remove # in   #options.add_argument("--headless=new")
